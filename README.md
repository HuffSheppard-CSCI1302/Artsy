## Completed extra-credit opportunity/ies

* Konami-code

  * Uses a picture with more than just Grumpy Cat.  May or may not also contain obnoxious music.  Instructor verified that this was okay.  

* URL-support

  * Implemented via menu-item, rather than via own stage.  Instructor verified that this was okay.  

## Overkill

This section describes things we did which were complete overkill, and which will hopefully amount to even more extra credit:  

* Entire GUI was coded by hand

* All icons were custom-made by hand for this project

* A Queue was used for to implement the Konami-code.  We have not gone over data-structures, and neither of us coders have used a queue before.
