This is a school-project completed by the below authors as part of UGA's Spring 2016 CSCI-1302 course.  It implements a GUI which allows one to combine any two 300x300px pictures in multiple ways.  

# Project Submission

## Completed extra-credit opportunity/ies

* Konami-code

  * Uses a picture with more than just Grumpy Cat.  May or may not also contain obnoxious music.  Instructor verified that this was okay.  

* URL-support

  * Implemented via menu-item, rather than via own stage.  Instructor verified that this was okay.  

## Overkill

This section describes things we did which were complete overkill, and which will hopefully amount to even more extra credit, or at least a by on the late-penalty:  

* Entire GUI was coded by hand.  

* All icons were custom-made by hand for this project.  Instructor is welcome to use them for future iterations of this project.  

* A <code>Queue</code> was used for to implement the Konami-code.  We have not gone over data-structures, and neither of us coders have used a queue before.  

* Menu was extended to perform all button-actions.  

* Extra buttons were provided below each picture.  

* Application can support pictures of dimensions different than 300x300px.
